* ´package.json´ has a ´scripts.prestart´ target that runs ´jsdoc´ (doc creation?)
  at runtime which requires a mutable runtime environment.
* The launch target ´astro dev´ (implied by ´npm start´) wants to write
  "injected types" into ´website/.astro/types.d.ts´ which requires a mutable runtime env.
  There is no content written to ´website/.astro/types.d´ at launch anyway.
